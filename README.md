# Chatter

This is a simple client, server chatting application.

A user may chat to someone, mroe users connected via the internet.

## Dependancies:

Please check the requirements.txt file for which libraries you may need to get this working.

This is based on a set of default Python libraries.


## How-To:

1. Start the `server.py`.
2. Start the `client.py` as many times or on as many machines as you wish.
3. Start messaging.


## Known bugs:

- A user will only recieve new messages when they send one themselves, this is something I plan to fix in the future.
